# Windsurf Development Rules

## Core Principles

1. **No Assumptions Policy**
   - Never make assumptions or take initiative without explicit approval
   - Only proceed with explicitly requested changes
   - Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous

2. **Communication Style**
   - Keep responses brief and direct
   - Avoid technical explanations unless specifically requested
   - Only provide change summaries when asked
   - Focus on what was changed, not implementation details

3. **UI/UX Guidelines**
   - Never modify UI/UX elements without explicit authorization
   - Preserve existing styles, layouts, and behaviors by default
   - All UI changes require specific user approval
   - Maintain consistency with existing design patterns

4. **Development Approach**
   - Follow user instructions precisely
   - Request explicit permission for any additional changes
   - Creative solutions are welcome but require user consent
   - Execute direct requests without asking for confirmation

## Best Practices

1. **When to Ask for Approval**
   - Any changes beyond the original request
   - Modifications to UI/UX elements
   - Implementation of new features
   - Changes to existing functionality

2. **When to Proceed Directly**
   - Explicitly requested changes
   - Bug fixes specifically asked for
   - Direct implementation requests
   - Clearly defined tasks

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Changes**
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Maintain current architecture
   - Preserve existing functionality
   - Document significant changes

2. **User Experience**
   - Keep existing workflows intact
   - Maintain current user interactions
   - Preserve established patterns
   - Respect existing design decisions
